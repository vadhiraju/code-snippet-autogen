# code-snippet-autogen

In order to improve developer speed and productivity, we are creating an IDE extension that allows users to generate code snippets automatically based on plain English phrases.

For example, a developer who wants to use binary search as a subroutine for her task can simply use the following command snip.getCodeSnippet("binary search") to generate a code template for generic binary search in her programming language of choice.
