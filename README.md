# code-snippet-autogen

In order to improve developer speed and productivity, we are creating an IDE extension that allows users to generate code snippets automatically based on plain English phrases.

For example, a developer who wants to use binary search as a subroutine for her task can simply use the following command snip.getCodeSnippet("binary search") to generate a code template for generic binary search in her programming language of choice.

## Features

## Examples of Autogenerated Code Snippets

## Programming Languages Supported
* Python
* Java
* C/C++

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Django OR Flask? <-- decide
* VSCode <-- other IDE?
* NoSQL database <-- which one?
* Heroku / AWS / GCP / Azure <-- which hosting?
* Javascript for browser version that works for Leetcode and other browser dev environments

## MEETING 9/11

* Java, Spring Boot
* Postgres, NoSQL DB

TODO
1. Do research on code generation -- find papers, code repos, etc.
1.5. Come up with system design / workflow
2. Build a small library of {word => code snippets} for testing purposes
3. Integrate with VSCode as IDE extension 
4. Possibly have NLP
